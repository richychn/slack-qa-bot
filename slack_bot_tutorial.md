# Customer Service Slack Bot - Implementation Guide

## Overview

Build a Slack bot that collects customer service conversations during the day, then uses AI to learn from them and create a smart knowledge base. The bot answers team questions only when confident about the answer.

## Architecture

```
Daily: Messages → Batch Learning → Knowledge Base → Smart Responses
```

The bot collects messages all day, then once daily uses Gemini to analyze conversations and update a curated knowledge base with facts, solutions, and procedures.

## Phase 1: Slack App Setup

### Step 1: Create Slack App
1. Go to https://api.slack.com/apps
2. Click "Create New App" → "From scratch"
3. Name it "CS Knowledge Bot"
4. Choose your workspace

### Step 2: Configure Permissions
In your app settings:
1. Go to "OAuth & Permissions"
2. Add these Bot Token Scopes:
   - `channels:history` - Read public channel messages
   - `channels:read` - View channel info
   - `chat:write` - Send messages as bot
   - `im:history` - Read DMs with bot
   - `im:read` - View DM info
   - `users:read` - View user info

### Step 3: Enable Events
1. Go to "Event Subscriptions"
2. Turn on "Enable Events"
3. Set Request URL to: `https://your-domain.com/slack/events` (you'll set this up later)
4. Subscribe to these bot events:
   - `message.channels` - Listen to channel messages
   - `message.im` - Listen to DMs
   - `app_mention` - When someone mentions the bot

### Step 4: Install App
1. Go to "Install App"
2. Click "Install to Workspace"
3. Save your Bot User OAuth Token (starts with `xoxb-`)
4. Go to "Basic Information" and copy your Signing Secret

## Phase 2: Project Foundation

### Step 5: Initialize Project
1. Create new Node.js project
2. Install dependencies:
   - `@slack/bolt` - Slack bot framework
   - `@google/generative-ai` - Gemini AI
   - `node-cron` - Scheduled tasks
   - `dotenv` - Environment variables
   - TypeScript development tools

### Step 6: Project Structure
Create this folder structure:
```
cs-knowledge-bot/
├── src/
│   ├── bot/
│   │   ├── app.ts (main bot application)
│   │   └── handlers/ (message and mention handlers)
│   ├── knowledge/
│   │   ├── store.ts (smart knowledge storage)
│   │   ├── learner.ts (batch learning processor)
│   │   └── types.ts (TypeScript interfaces)
│   ├── services/
│   │   ├── gemini.ts (AI service)
│   │   └── confidence.ts (confidence calculation)
│   └── utils/
│       └── logger.ts (logging utility)
├── data/ (auto-created for storing knowledge)
├── .env (environment variables)
└── package.json
```

### Step 7: Environment Configuration
Create `.env` file with:
- `SLACK_BOT_TOKEN` - Your bot token from Step 4
- `SLACK_SIGNING_SECRET` - Your signing secret from Step 4  
- `GEMINI_API_KEY` - Get from https://aistudio.google.com/app/apikey
- `PORT=3000`
- `CONFIDENCE_THRESHOLD=0.8`

## Phase 3: Core Bot Implementation

### Step 8: Main Bot Application
Create the main Slack bot that:
1. Connects to Slack using Bot Framework
2. Sets up message and mention event handlers
3. Initializes knowledge store and learning system
4. Schedules daily learning at 2 AM using cron
5. Provides HTTP endpoints for health checks and analytics

### Step 9: Message Collection Handler
Build a handler that:
1. Listens to messages in specified customer service channels (like 'customer-support', 'help-desk')
2. Filters for support-related content using keywords
3. Adds qualifying messages to a daily collection batch
4. Ignores non-support channels and irrelevant messages

### Step 10: Question Response Handler  
Create a handler that:
1. Responds when the bot is mentioned with a question
2. Retrieves the current knowledge base
3. Uses AI to generate an answer with confidence score
4. Only responds if confidence exceeds the threshold (default 80%)
5. Provides reasoning for confidence level

---

## Phase 4: Smart Knowledge System

### Step 11: Knowledge Store
Build a storage system that:
1. Collects messages during the day in memory
2. Maintains a persistent knowledge base file
3. Provides methods to add messages, get knowledge, and update memory
4. Handles file I/O for loading/saving knowledge
5. Manages memory size limits and provides stats

### Step 12: Batch Learning Processor
Create a learning system that:
1. Processes all collected messages once daily
2. Sends current knowledge + new messages to Gemini
3. Asks Gemini to update knowledge by adding new facts, updating existing info, removing outdated content
4. Saves the updated knowledge base
5. Clears the daily message collection
6. Provides learning session summaries

---

## Phase 5: AI Integration

### Step 13: Gemini Service
Implement AI service that:
1. Connects to Google's Gemini API
2. Processes user questions against knowledge base
3. Returns structured responses with confidence scores and reasoning
4. Handles knowledge base updates during learning
5. Analyzes knowledge quality and completeness
6. Includes proper error handling and safety settings

### Step 14: Confidence Enhancement
Build confidence system that:
1. Takes Gemini's base confidence score
2. Applies adjustments based on knowledge base size, question type, response quality
3. Boosts confidence for common questions with detailed answers
4. Reduces confidence for technical questions or short responses
5. Ensures confidence stays between 0 and 1

---

## Phase 6: Management & Analytics

### Step 15: Analytics Endpoints
Add HTTP endpoints for:
1. `/health` - Basic health check
2. `/analytics` - View current stats and knowledge preview
3. `/update-knowledge` - Manually trigger learning process
4. `/knowledge-quality` - Analyze knowledge base quality
5. `/reset-knowledge` - Clear knowledge (for testing)
6. `/export-knowledge` - Download knowledge backup

### Step 16: Logging & Monitoring
Implement logging for:
1. Message collection activity
2. Daily learning process results
3. Query processing and confidence scores
4. Knowledge base size and growth
5. Error conditions and API failures

---

## Phase 7: Testing & Deployment

### Step 17: Local Testing
Test the system by:
1. Starting the bot locally
2. Sending test messages in your customer service channels
3. Manually triggering knowledge updates via API
4. Asking the bot questions and monitoring confidence
5. Checking analytics endpoints for proper data

### Step 18: Production Setup
For deployment:
1. Choose hosting platform (Railway, Render, Heroku, etc.)
2. Set up ngrok for local development event URL
3. Update Slack app Event Subscription URL to your deployed domain
4. Configure production environment variables
5. Set up monitoring and backup procedures

## Key Features Summary

**Smart Learning**: Bot learns from conversations and builds organized knowledge rather than just storing raw messages

**Confidence-Based Responses**: Only answers when highly confident, maintaining team trust

**Batch Processing**: Efficient daily learning reduces API costs and improves knowledge quality

**Persistent Memory**: Knowledge survives restarts and continues improving over time

**Easy Management**: Web endpoints for monitoring, manual updates, and knowledge export

**Scalable Architecture**: Can easily add more channels, adjust learning frequency, or enhance features

This approach gives you an intelligent customer service assistant that actually learns and improves from your team's conversations, providing increasingly helpful responses while maintaining high confidence standards.
